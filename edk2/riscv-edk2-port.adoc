# RISC-V edk2 Port Introduction
***

## RISC-V edk2 Port on Tianocore GitHub edk2 Repository
The edk2 master branch currently supports RISC-V architecture. The release tag of RISC-V edk2 port is "edk2-stable202005", https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/edk2-stable202005. +
The essential code upstream to edk2 enables the build process for RISC-V on edk2 fundamental packages, such as MdePkg, MdeModulePkg, NetworkPkg, BaseTools and etc.
GCC5 toolchain currently supports the build process of edk2 foundation for RISC-V 64-bit processor, the architecture is denominated as "RISCV64". +
RISC-V GitHub also maintains the copy of edk2 repository (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-edk2), which is used as the development codebase for RISC-V architecture features based on edk2
foundation.

## RISC-V Packages on Tianocore GitHub edk2-platforms Repository
**RISC-V processor package** and **RISC-V platform package** are current located on "devel-riscvplatforms" branch under edk2-platforms repository (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms).
Those RISC-V related packages provides the fundamental edk2 drivers for RISC-V processor and common platform implementations for RISC-V platforms. +
**RISC-V platform reference code** is located in silicon vendor specific folder under Platform in edk2-platforms repository as well. The implementations of RISC-V platforms are released by silicon vendor as the
sample code for the OEMs. +
RISC-V GitHub also maintains the copy of edk2-platforms repository (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-edk2-platforms) which is used as the development codebase for RISC-V processor features
and platforms.

## RISC-V edk2 Processor Package
RISC-V processor package is located in ```Silicon/RISC-V/ProcessorPkg``` folder under edk2-platforms repository, which is the RISC-V edk2 port with RISC-V OpenSBI (https://github.com/riscv/opensbi)
library integrated.

```
ProcessorPkg   - 	RISC-V processor package. This package provides RISC-V processor
					related protocols and libraries according to UEFI specification and
					edk2 implementations.
               -    OpensbiTypes.h under ProcessorPkg/Include is the OpenSBI external
					definitions for edk2 framework, which leverages the macro
					OPENSBI_EXTERNAL_SBI_TYPES to use edk2 type definitions.
```

## RISC-V edk2 Platform Packages
RISC-V platform package is located in ```Platform/RISC-V/PlatformPkg``` under edk2-platforms repository, which provides the generic and common modules for RISC-V platforms.

```
PlatformPkg     - 	RISC-V platform package. This package provides RISC-V platform common
					modules, libraries, PCDs and definitions.
```
Refer to https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/blob/master/Platform/RISC-V/PlatformPkg/Readme.md[Readme] for more information.

## RISC-V edk2 Platform Reference Code
RISC-V platform reference code is located under ```Platform/{Vendor}``` on edk2-platforms repository. It incorporates with ProcessorPkg, PlatformPkg and RISC-V core edk2 driver as 
the reference platform for OEMs. Currently we have two sample platforms as listed below,
```
FreedomU500VC707Board            - 	SiFive Freedome U500 platform which is maintained
									under Platform/SiFive/U5SeriesPkg.

FreedomU540HiFiveUnleashedBoard  - 	SiFive Freedome U540 HiFive Unleashed platform which
									is maintained under Platform/SiFive/U5SeriesPkg.
```
Refer to https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/blob/master/Platform/SiFive/U5SeriesPkg/Readme.md[Readme] for more information.

## RISC-V Core edk2 Drivers
RISC-V core edk2 drivers are released by silicon vendor which provide the processor-specific driver such as building up the SMBIOS record and core information.

|===
| Vendor | Model | Location

|**SiFive**|E51|Silicon/E51
|**SiFive**|U54|Silicon/U54
|**SiFive**|U54MC Coreplex|Silicon/U54MCCoreplex

## Toolchain of RISC-V edk2 port
You have to clone the toolchain (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain) from above link and follow the installation
guidance mentioned in README.md for building RISC-V edk2 port.

This toolchain has been tested on below Linux distribution, +
**Distributor ID:** Ubuntu +
**Description:**    Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS +
**Release:**        16.04 +
GCC 9.2.0 is currently supported in RISC-V GNU toolchain. +

Build issues may happen on other Linux distributions and have not been discovered
due to it is out of edk2 RISC-V contribution scope.

## edk2 Build Target
"RISCV64" ARCH is the RISC-V architecture which currently supported and verified.
The verified RISC-V toolchain is https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
and the toolchain tag is "GCC5" which is declared in ```tools_def.txt```.
Below is the edk2 build options for building RISC-V RV64 platform,
```
build -a RISCV64 -p Platform/{Vendor}/{Platform}/{Platform}.dsc -t GCC5
```
For example,
```
build -a RISCV64 -p Platform/SiFive/U5SeriesPkg/FreedomU500VC707Board/U500.dsc
-t GCC5
```

Make sure RISC-V toolchain is built successfully and the toolchain binaries are generated in somewhere you specified when building toolchain.
'GCC5_RISCV64_PREFIX' is the cross compilation prefix to toolchain binaries.
For example, set ```GCC5_RISCV64_PREFIX``` to ```~/RiscVToolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf-```
before you build RISC-V edk2 port.
